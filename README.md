# Predicting_Car_Prices_with_KNN
A quick project to build a predictive model for car pricing using KNN.  
The model uses prices, other car features, and various k values to create, train and test univariate and multivariate models.  
Visualizations were built with a slider to enable the reader to interact with the data.
